#Que:1 Create two matrices from the given set of numbers X1 = {2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1} and x2 = {3,2,9,0,7,8,5,8,2}
#Answer:
A = matrix(c(2,3,7,1,6,2,3,5,1), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
A
B = matrix(c(3,2,9,0,7,8,5,8,2), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
B


#Que:2 Find the matrix product.
#Answer:
C = A%*%B
C


#Que:3What does correlation coefficient represent? How do you find the correlation between (i) two categorical variables and (ii)categorical variable and continuous variable.
#Answer: 
#The correlation coefficient of two variables in a data set equals to their covariance divided by the product of their individual standard deviations. It is a normalized measurement of how the two are linearly related.

#(i)Frequency table, relative frequency table and bar chart etc.

#(ii)Z-test/t-test (Either test assess whether mean of two groups are statistically different from each other or not


#Que4:Load the Animals data set from the "MASS" package
#Answer:
library(MASS)
data(Animals)
head(Animals)


#Que:5 Find the correlation coefficient of brain and body in this data set and comment on the relation between them
#Answer:
body <- Animals$body
brain <- Animals$brain
cor(brain, body)
cor(Animals)


#Que:6 Load USArrests data set. Comment on the distribution of the variables. Is there any relation between UrbanPop and three crimes
#Answer:
summary(USArrests)
cor(USArrests)
#Running plot for these combinations, Murder and Assault do not appear to have a relation to UrbanPop. The distribution of plot points are scattered to the point that they do not appear to correlate to UrbanPop.
with(USArrests, plot(UrbanPop, Murder))
with(USArrests, plot(UrbanPop, Assault))
#Plotting Rape against UrbanPop - there are some outliers, but there does seem to be a relationship between Rape and UrbanPop. There is an indication of a correlation and more analysis could be performed
with(USArrests, plot(UrbanPop, Rape))

#Que:7 Which states has most and least assault, murder, and rape arrests.
#Answer:
# most and least assault
x <- which(USArrests$Assault == max(USArrests$Assault))
rownames(USArrests)[x]
x <- which(USArrests$Assault == min(USArrests$Assault))
rownames(USArrests)[x]
# most and least murder
x<-which(USArrests$Murder == max(USArrests$Murder))
rownames(USArrests)[x]
x <- which(USArrests$Murder == min(USArrests$Murder))
rownames(USArrests)[x]
# most and least rape
x<-which(USArrests$Rape == max(USArrests$Rape))
rownames(USArrests)[x]
x <- which(USArrests$Rape == min(USArrests$Rape))
rownames(USArrests)[x]


#Que:8 List the states which have assault arrests more than median of the country.
#Answer:
assault.median = median(USArrests$Assault)
assault.median
subset(USArrests, Assault > assault.median, select= c(UrbanPop, Assault))


#Que:9 Which states are in the bottom 25% of murder
#Answer:
bottomQuartileMurderRate <- quantile(USArrests$Murder)[2]
bottomQuartileMurderRate
subset(USArrests, Murder < bottomQuartileMurderRate, select= c(UrbanPop, Murder))


#Que:10 Which states are in the top 25% of the murder.
#Answer:
topQuartileMurderRate <- quantile(USArrests$Murder)[4]
topQuartileMurderRate
subset(USArrests, Murder > topQuartileMurderRate, select= c(UrbanPop, Murder))
